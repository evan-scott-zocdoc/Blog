What is the purpose of installing Zsh instead of Bash?

For one thing I find Zsh with the correct setup considerably more helpful to read through the command lines. You can look at it, and make your own judgement.

How do you install a similar version of Zsh?

1. You'll first need to clone and install Robby Russell's Oh-My-Zsh repository. His GitHub repo is very well explained. [link] https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh
2. Once this is done, you'll have to install Homebrew on your Terminal console. Download Homebrew [link]https://github.com/Homebrew/install/archive/master.zip [link] and double-click on the Install file. This will automatically open your Terminal app and proceed to the installation.
3. You can then setup the Zsh theme called Prezto. What is it? Prezto is a configuration framework for Zsh. It adds to the command lines not only a considerably easier readability (something I appreciate a lot) but also embeds a number of helpful aliases and autocompletions that will simplify your life.

The installation procedure is again well explained on the Readme documentation in the repo. [image]
