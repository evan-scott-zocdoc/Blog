This is the begining of several tutorials to create a fun 3D world with Three.js on WebGL technology. Our end result will look like that:

Let's first create a blank HTML page.
```HTML
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Three.js Test</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
  </html>
```

The first step to have a successful 3D scene is to have full control over a few components. Those are:
* the camera positioning
* a light source
* objects to cast and receive shadows

The reason to use shadows is to allow our brain understand the relative distance between objects.
